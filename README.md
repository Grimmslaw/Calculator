# Calculator
Basic Calculator in Java

I'm reinvinting the wheel; only the wheel has less functionality and looks super ugly. Purely for learning purposes, although I won't stop you from using it for actual math or anything, obviously.

JFrame requiring clicking the buttons with a mouse until I can figure out Key-pressing listeners.

So far it features:
* operations
  * adding
  * subtracting
  * multiplying
  * dividing
* decimal
* clearing all

Although there are buttons for future implementation of:
* changing to and from negative
* clearing just the entry

Also planned is to make it like most calculators where the full expression doesn't show, instead having the operation appear on the opposite side of the display and only the showing the current number being typed.
